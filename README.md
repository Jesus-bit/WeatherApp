## Overview

![screenshot](https://jesus-bit.github.io/WeatherApp/tree/master/assets/img/2021-09-22.png)

This is a web application that gives you the weather according to your location or you can search for other cities. The challenges I faced when building it were:

- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) resolving
- Get the API data
- Position the icon towards the wind
- When obtaining the user's location
